# CS-230-Operational-Systems

The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that created Draw It or Lose It as an Android-based game and wanted to expand it into a web-based, multi-platform application. Their main requirement was to allow multiple teams and players to participate in shared game sessions while ensuring that game, team, and player names remained unique. Another key requirement was that only one instance of the game service exist in memory at any given time, which required careful design to support scalability and consistency across platforms.

One thing I did particularly well in this project was clearly defining the system structure and applying object-oriented design principles. Creating the domain model helped me understand how the different entities in the system relate to one another, and it made design decisions like using a singleton for the game service much more logical. Working through the design document before writing code was especially helpful because it allowed me to identify constraints, platform considerations, and potential issues early, which made the coding process more organized and efficient.

If I were to revise one part of the documentation, I would improve the system architecture section by adding more detail about how client requests flow through the application. This would make the design easier to understand for both technical and non-technical readers. When designing the software, I focused on interpreting user needs such as ease of use, uniqueness of names, and cross-platform access, since these directly affect the user experience. Considering user needs is critical because even technically correct software can fail if it does not meet user expectations. Overall, I approached software design by breaking the problem into smaller components, using proven design patterns, and evaluating platform tradeoffs. In the future, I would continue using structured design documents, UML diagrams, and early requirement analysis to guide the design of similar applications.
